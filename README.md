# MidbrainOrganoid_scRNAseq
R scripts for scRNAseq analysis of midbrain organoids from human iPSCs

R notebook with 
filtering, integrating, clustering, annotating and looking at gene expression within clusters from two samples of three midbrain organoids.
separate R scripts computational intensive processes used to explore clusters at different resolutions.

Analysis will be found in the manuscript:
Mohamed, Nguyen-Vi, et al. "Midbrain organoids with an SNCA gene triplication model key features of synucleinopathy." bioRxiv (2021).

The raw data will be posted on GEO soon.
We are working on a solution to post the process R (Seurat data object). Please contact us for the processed data objects in the mean time.
