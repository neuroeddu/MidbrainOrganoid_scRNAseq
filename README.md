# MidbrainOrganoid_scRNAseq
R scripts for scRNAseq analysis of midbrain organoids from human iPSCs

R notebook with 
filtering, integrating, clustering, annotating and looking at gene expression within clusters from two samples of three midbrain organoids.
separate R scripts computational intensive processes used to explore clusters at different resolutions.

Analysis will be found in the manuscript:
